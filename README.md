Log In - Sign Up (Web Developement Project)

I successfully completed my inaugural web project as part of the web development internship at "Nexus Private Limited." 
This project features a straightforward log-in and sign-up page with fundamental validation mechanisms. 
I'm new to web development, but I've got some experience with Java projects. It helped me figure out the behind-the-scenes stuff for this simple log-in and sign-up page. 
I acknowledge that there is always room for improvement, and I am committed to refining my skills and knowledge in the coming days. This initial endeavor marks the beginning of my journey in web development, 
and I am eager to tackle more projects and enhance my proficiency. I appreciate constructive feedback from my experienced peers in the field as I strive to grow and excel.
